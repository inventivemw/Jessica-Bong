Text: Who has the greater influence? The Korean Pop Star/Youtube Hit, or the odd Australian Politician? A Swedish Furniture store of an economist on Wall St? The sphere of power has evolved over the past decades from the solid power figures in governments and militia to the less obvious onesâ€”mainstream, consumer and celebrity culture. An investigative digital publication to Soft Power as it exists in the world, and evaluating who has more of it.
