Text: As Art Director of Esperanto Magazine, it has been an honour to work on a wide variety of projects with a tight team. This is one of my favourite issues, 'The Creative Issues.' We interview typographer Gemma O'Brien, singer/song writer Kate Miller Hiedke, designers Nadine Chahine, Marion Bantjes, Jack Musset, Ned Culic, Andrew Ashton (just to name a few!)

The full control of aesthetics meant that we could be experimental in stock, layout and bind.
